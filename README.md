# Car-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
To be able to predict used cars market value can help both buyers and sellers. There are lots of individuals who are interested in the used car market at some points in their life because they wanted to sell their car or buy a used car. In this process, it’s a big corner to pay too much or sell less then it’s market value.

In this Project, we are going to predict the Price of Used Cars using various features like Present_Price, Selling_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Year etc. The data used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle.

Following steps will be followed to reach our goal:

Importing libraries

Reading the concerned dataset

Data Understanding

Data handling

Data visualization

Data preparation

Splitting the Data and feature scaling

Building a linear regression model

Residual analysis of the train data

Making Predictions Using the Final Model

Model Evaluation

Conclusion
